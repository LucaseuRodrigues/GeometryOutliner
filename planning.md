GEOMTRY OUTLINER DOCUMENTATION 

PRIMORDIAL IDEA
THE HOME PAGE SHOULD DEMONSTRATE A FORM THAT WI'LL BE USE TO SEND INFOMATIONS ABOUT THE 
COORDINATES OF THE AREA AND A MAP WHERE THE OUTLINE WI'LL BE SHOWN.

STEPS TO IT

FIRST STEP
SHOW THE MAP IN THE WEB PAGE
SECOND STEP
USER TYPES THE COORDINATES 
THIRD STEP 
THE GEOMETRY AREA IS INTERPRETED AND GENERATED BY THE CODE
FOURTH STEP
THE POLYGON IS STORED IN USER'S TEMPORARY HISTORY.
FITH STEP 
SHOW'S A MESSAGE ASKING TO SAVE THE POLYGON, IF HE CONFIRM'S THE MESSAGE IT WILL BE SAVED, ELSE ITS DELETED

-------------

PLANNING DISCUSSION

IT'S A MULTI-POINT MODEL DERIVED, THE USER GONNA GIVE A DETERMINATED NUMBER OF COORDINATES AND THE SCRIPT GONNA INTERPRET IT MAKING THE POLYGON AROUND THE AREA GAVE.
